# Vue Component Library Boilerplate

:wave: This is a boilerplate for developing vue component libraries. This project aims to be the love-child of [prograhammer's vue-library-template](https://github.com/prograhammer/vue-library-template) and [chrisvfritz's vue-enterprise-boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate), to create an opinionated vue component library with side-by-side library/docs development, publish hooks, generators, pre-configured components, base styles, unit tests and more.

## Credits and inspiration

:heart: This project is built on top of the versatile [vue-library-template](https://github.com/prograhammer/vue-library-template) by [prograhammer](https://github.com/prograhammer), which is great for quickly prototyping and publishing a vue library on npm.

:heart: This project is heavily inspired by [Chris Fritz's](https://github.com/chrisvfritz) 'must-read' [vue-enterprise-boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate) which is the gold-standard for Vue SPA projects. [This talk](https://youtu.be/7lpemgMhi0k) by Chris Fritz explains many of the patterns used and advocated in this project, and comes highly recommended - his energy is amazing!
